        <h6>GRAPHIC DESIGN // PHOTOGRAPHY</h6>
      <br>I started off as a self-taught artist; learning I was left-handed at just 2 years old, and finding a love for drawing and flipbooks. It wasn't until grade school that I took a particular interest in media design as well as a brief intro to learning how websites worked. It was then that I learned that there is a designer behind all of things I loved, and I wanted to become one myself.</br>

      <p>I continued excelling in digital media-related electives, until I pursued an Associates of Arts in Media Arts at Santa Barbara City College, and continued my education for a Graphic Arts BA in the media epicenter of the Bay Area at CSU East Bay.</p>
