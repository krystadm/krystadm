        <h2>KRYSTA MADEWELL</h2>
        Hello! My name is Krysta Madewell and I am a graphic designer from the Bay Area, California! I grew up in a multicultural, Asian-American family. As a mixed kid always on the move, Iâ€™ve gotten to experience life and culture all around my home state, country, and different parts of the globe. Traditional art and technology has always been a hobby for me since I was a kid. As I got older, my hobbies shifted into traveling, music, food and online creator communities. I started to realize how design played a huge part in not only what I enjoyed doing, but how it shaped the world around me.<p>
        </p>

    Since then, I have implemented design into my craft, giving me a multi-faceted range of skills. I specialize in design for branding, promotional advertising, as well as visually implementing other ideas useful for web and print design. The concept of communication through design is very important to me and is one of the easiest and effective ways to send a message to a mass audience. My goal is to assist others visually translate their message to the world, and continue to be inspired and motivated as design evolves.<p>
