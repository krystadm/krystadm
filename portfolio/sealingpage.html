There was no way to get information for or purchase products, applicants could not find our Applicant Manager due to the careers section being spread across multiple pages, and no way for existing customers to get support. Through a heuristic approach, we walked through the original website with a web developer to pinpoint where exactly we needed to make changes and what we needed to add.</o>

Whichever page users signed up from would categorize their information into lists based on the page's main service, and connect them to the right team. It was important to divide pages into specific categories with their own individual goal.</p>

                      <p>At the point of coming up with user flows and creating mockups, I was still learning about the business model for the company; the federal market and product lifecycle was more complex and traditional than I imagined, and there were a lot of restrictions and security risks for how digital marketing collects information. For the product journey, I had to find a good midpoint between modern B2B IT customer solutions and condensing information necessary to build trust for federal customers into something quick and digital.  Stakeholders weren't sure how they wanted to tailor the hardware product journey, so they wanted to see what it would look like in an "e-commerce" format along with building credibility for the company itself through an easily navigatable and functional website. In addition, these ideas needed to be compatible with our sales, marketing, and support platforms.</p>

                      <p>For most of the website relaunch process, I did not have guidelines or language to use because I was creating them simultaneously; Being the first in-house designer/content writer/marketing associate meant much of the brand guidelines, voice, and design systems were not established so I had few resources to reference with limited support. I took themes from their logo, previous technical documentation, and competitor trends to evolve the identity carefully to match leadership's vision. <p>Because of COVID-19, there were countless windows for digital media and information formats, which came with the challenge of meeting federal accessibility guidelines and making highly technical information easy to digest. Over time, I was cross-referencing my delivery rapidly, updating everything with each visual milestone, and kept evolving the identity. <p>Keeping in mind the challenges I faced throughout my time, I created an official design documentation for future designers to reference the information that could have helped me throughout my journey.</p>

                      <p>Since this was my first major UX project, it definitely wasn't easy, and I was grateful for the support of our remote development team along the way who taught me the rundown of how to design for handoff and still helped me deliver and launch the website despite my early knowledge of UX. I missed a lot of important steps in my process, some were done incorrectly, and I think a lot of minor elements like visual design were more prioritized than the user experience and accessibility, which was more work to correct over time. But the best part about being a designer is that it's so much easier to learn from your mistakes and improve to bring the best delivery when you get to reapproach it. This website's relaunch helped enrich so many processes for the customers and internal teams within the company, and I'm glad to be a part of something both revolutionary and helpful.
